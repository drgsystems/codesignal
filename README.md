This is a suite of test cases written in C, C++, Python and Python with mysql.
The objective is to demonstrate solutions to the codesignal exercises which 
are excellent for learning or re-establishing mastery in programming.

I've tried to include the test description from codesignal as well as test
cases in a test framework.
