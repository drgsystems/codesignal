# Given a string consisting of lowercase English letters, find the largest 
# square number which can be obtained by reordering the string's characters 
# and replacing them with any digits you need (leading zeros are not allowed) 
# where same characters always map to the same digits and different characters 
# always map to different digits.

# If there is no solution, return -1.

# Example

    # For s = "ab", the output should be
    # solution(s) = 81.
    # The largest 2-digit square number with different digits is 81.
    # For s = "zzz", the output should be
    # solution(s) = -1.
    # There are no 3-digit square numbers with identical digits.
    # For s = "aba", the output should be
    # solution(s) = 900.
    # It can be obtained after reordering the initial string into "baa" and 
	# replacing "a" with 0 and "b" with 9.
